An interactive AI-powered virtual therapist built using **Unreal Engine 5** and **Convai**, designed to simulate supportive, emotionally intelligent conversations in real-time.

---

## Overview

This project allows users to hold spoken conversations with a virtual therapist NPC who listens and responds empathetically using voice and natural language AI. Developed as part of a **college hackathon**, the goal was to explore how game engines and generative AI could be combined to address emotional wellness and mental health support.

## Motivation

The mental health space is often underserved, especially for individuals who may hesitate to open up in traditional therapy settings. This project aims to demonstrate how **real-time, conversational AI** embedded in virtual environments could help lower that barrier by:

- Providing anonymous, judgment-free interaction
- Creating an emotionally safe virtual space
- Showcasing a new way to experience empathy from technology
  
## Core Features

- **Voice-to-Voice Interaction**  
  Users speak directly to the therapist NPC; AI responds verbally and emotionally.

- **Convai AI Integration**  
  Uses Convaiâ€™s LLM-powered API for generating context-aware, human-like dialogue.

- **Session Memory**  
  The therapist NPC retains context during a session, allowing for fluid and natural conversation.

- **MetaHuman Expression**  
  Realistic facial expressions reflect emotional tones of the dialogue.

- **Unreal Blueprints**  
  Game logic and interactions are designed using Blueprint scripting (no external code required).
  

## Hackathon Build

This was created during a 36-hour college hackathon centered around the theme of **social innovation through technology**. The project stood out for combining:

- AI-driven interaction with real emotional depth
- Technical implementation using a AAA-level game engine
- Thoughtful use of human-AI communication design

## Potential Impact

While this was built as a short-term hackathon project, its underlying idea has long-term relevance:

- **Education & awareness**: A tool to teach users how to express and reflect on their emotions.
- **Mental health support**: Could supplement professional care by offering immediate, 24/7 companionship for emotional regulation.
- **Game development**: Demonstrates the future of NPCs with real empathy and adaptive behavior.
- **Accessibility**: Offers a non-judgmental space, potentially helpful for those hesitant to seek traditional help.

If further developed, such AI-powered conversational agents could become valuable companions in therapeutic games, educational simulations, or even day-to-day wellness apps.


## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `.uproject` file in **Unreal Engine 5**.
3. Add your **Convai API key** inside the `ConvaiConnector` Blueprint.
4. Press **Play** in the Unreal editor.
5. Use your mic to begin interacting with the therapist NPC.

> Make sure your mic access is enabled and a Convai developer account is set up.
